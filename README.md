# Overview
PortPeaker v2 is a significant upgrade from the original PortPeaker port scanner and banner grabber. Designed to be simple yet powerful, this new version leverages Pythonâ€™s socket programming alongside colorful terminal output to provide clear, user-friendly port scanning and banner grabbing for common TCP services.

# Key Improvements in PortPeaker v2
## 1. Improved Code Structure & Reliability
Redesigned with Python's with statement for socket handling, ensuring safe and automatic resource management (no need for manual socket closing).

Enhanced exception handling to catch a broader range of errors cleanly, making scans more stable.

Uniform timeout handling for all ports, improving scan consistency.

## 2. Enhanced User Experience
Integrated Colorama library for colored, easy-to-read console output:

Cyan prompt for IP/host input

Green for successful open ports and banner grabs

Red for closed ports, timeouts, and errors

Clean and informative status messages that improve clarity during scans.

## 3. Efficient Banner Grabbing
Attempts to receive and decode service banners from open ports.

Gracefully handles ports that donâ€™t respond or close connections abruptly.

Provides clear placeholders for missing or unreadable banners.

## 4. Simplified & Readable Code
Well-commented code for easy understanding and future customization.

Consistent indentation and style for maintainability.

# Dependencies

PortPeaker v2 requires the following dependency:

- [`colorama`](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) â€” used for colored terminal output.

You can install it easily via pip:

```bash
pip install colorama
```

# Future Roadmap (Coming Soon)
- Custom port range scanning
- Multi-threaded scanning for speed improvements
- Export scan results to files (CSV/JSON)
- Service identification and fingerprinting
